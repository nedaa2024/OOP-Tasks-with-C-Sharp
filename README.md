# OOP-Tasks

## Description
This project involves three exercises in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of OOP such as generics, file handling, and LINQ.

### Exercise 1
- **Objective**: Create a generic class to represent a generic list, with methods to add elements and display the first element. Then, make a meaningful execution in the `Main` method.

### Exercise 2
- **Objective**: Append the content read from text document 1 to text document 2 and calculate the total number of words in text document 2 using lambda expressions or LINQ.

### Exercise 3
- **Objective**: 
  - Create a `City` class to represent the city name and region.
  - Create a `School` class to represent the school’s name and space.
  - Create a `Teacher` class to represent the teacher’s name and ID.
  - Display the city’s schools and school’s teachers in an organized way using LINQ, adding appropriate properties as needed.
  - Display the school information that has the highest number of teachers.

## Usage
Clone the repository and open the solution in your preferred C# IDE (like Visual Studio). Implement the exercises as described and run the `Main` method to see the results.
